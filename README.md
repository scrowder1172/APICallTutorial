This is from Chase's Medium articles about calling APIs from iOS apps. This project creates an iOS app that calls APIs from https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com

### Personal Additions

* Code improvements: Chase's original article was written in February 2023. I updated the code based off iOS 17 improvements (e.g. @Observable instead of Observable protocol). I also built navigation for more details
* Navigation: I added navigation to the project that shows additional details in a separate view
* Tabbed view: I made the main view a tab view for easy switching between posts and users
* User data: I added a call to the users endpoint to parse more complicated JSON. You can use the User class as an example for parsing nested JSON (this data is 2-3 levels deep)
* Computed properties: I added computed properties for User that simplifies the address and company information
* Subviews: I moved a lot of code into reusable views to clean up the view code

## How to install
